# Unity Editor Analytics

You can disable all editor analytics in Unity > Preferences.
The EditorAnalytics API is for Unity to collect usage data for this samples project in order to improve our products.
The EditorAnalytics API won't be useful in your own project because it only works in the Editor and the data is only sent to Unity.

To see how you could implement analytics in your own project,
have a look at the AB Test Level Difficulty sample or the Seasonal Events sample.
